# Dovetail

<i>Dovetail</i> is a fantasy sandbox adventure. You begin the game with tools designed to cultivate the land. In doing so, you will attract new residents, unlock events, and complete objectives.

## Technology

This game is built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

For persistent state management I used <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage" target="_blank">localStorage</a> as it allows for no expiration time and remains after browser closing (unless viewed in “private browsing” tab).

<a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a> was used for the title font, ‘<i>Lavishly Yours</i>,’ found on the splash page. Icons from Google Font library, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/icons?selected=Material+Symbols+Outlined:close:FILL@0;wght@400;GRAD@0;opsz@48" target="_blank">material symbols</a>.

Character models and textures were created using CSS. Other artwork was generated using <a href="https://stablediffusionweb.com/" target="_blank">Stable Diffusion</a> and edited with <a href="https://www.photopea.com/">Photopea</a>.

Royalty free sound effects are from <a href="https://pixabay.com/" target="_blank">Pixabay</a> and cropped with <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a>.
